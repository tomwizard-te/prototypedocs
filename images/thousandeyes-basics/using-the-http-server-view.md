# Using the HTTP Server view



When you create any HTTP Server or Page Load test, you get access to the HTTP Server view.  The HTTP Server view leverages the ThousandEyes standard layout, documented here: [https://support.thousandeyes.com/ViewArticle?articleIdParam=kA0E0000000CmmgKAC](https://success.thousandeyes.com/ViewArticle?articleIdParam=kA0E0000000CmmgKAC).  

This article highlights specifics shown in the HTTP Server view.

## Example

This example shows the result of an HTTP Server test

![HTTP-Server-View](https://success.thousandeyes.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka044000000UKwk&feoid=00NE0000006OT0r&refid=0EM2R000000CSGv)

## View Specifics

The HTTP Server test measures the following metrics:

* Availability: Percentage of time that the site is available, aggregated across all agents.
* Response time: Also known as Time-to-first-byte, this is the time elapsed from the beginning of the request \(before DNS request\) until the client receives the first byte of the response from the server.
* Throughput: is calculated by dividing the total wire size to the receive time and expressed in Mbps

For more details on available metrics, access the knowledge base article here: [https://support.thousandeyes.com/ViewArticle?articleIdParam=kA0E0000000CmmzKAC](https://success.thousandeyes.com/ViewArticle?articleIdParam=kA0E0000000CmmzKAC)

The HTTP Server view shows two different data views, depending on whether or not a location is selected, and varies somewhat depending on which metric is selected.  Details for each selected metric are shown below.

#### Availability

The Availability for a given agent should be 100% if the HTTP status code is 2xx or 3xx, and 0% otherwise. The average Availability can take any value from 0% to 100%.
