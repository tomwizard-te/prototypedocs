# Working with time zone settings

The ThousandEyes platform offers user-configurable time zones for ThousandEyes test results, reports and report snapshots, live shares and notification emails. Time zone settings can be changed on a per-ThousandEyes user level or at an organization level.

### **Web Interface**: 

Sets the time zone for the results timelines of View pages \(test results\) and reports **for the current user only**, navigate to the **Profile** tab of the [Account Settings &gt; Users and Roles](https://app.thousandeyes.com/account-settings/users-roles/?section=profile). The settings can be changed from the **Web Interface** dropdown in Time Zone section.

### Share links
