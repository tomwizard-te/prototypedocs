# Where can I get the Account Group Token?

The Account Group Token is an alphanumeric string used to bind an [Enterprise Agent](https://success.thousandeyes.com/PublicArticlePage?articleIdParam=kA0E0000000CmnbKAC_What-is-an-Enterprise-Agent?) to a specific Account Group. The Account Group Token is not a password which must be kept secret.

The token can be retrieved in two different views in the app, as illustrated in the following sections.

## Account Settings Page

The Account Group Token can be found in the [Account Settings](https://app.thousandeyes.com/settings/account/?section=accountgroups) page of the app, in the **Account Groups** tab \(1\):

## Agent Settings Page

The second location where the Account Group Token can be obtained is the Enterprise Agents tab of the [Agent Settings](https://app.thousandeyes.com/settings/agents/enterprise/?section=agents) page:
