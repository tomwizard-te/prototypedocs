# Navigating our new menus

On April 2nd, 2019, we introduced a new set of menus for the navigation bar on the left side of the application. With the new menu structure we have moved many of the pages and tabs to different locations, in an effort to provide a better, more convenient user experience. On August 6th, 2019 Account Settings menus were also moved to the left hand side menu.  This article provides a mapping of the old pages and other elements to their new locations, should customers need help navigating with the new menus.
