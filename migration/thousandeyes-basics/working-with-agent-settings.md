## Cloud & Enterprise Agents

Cloud and Enterprise Agents can be configured When navigating to the [**Cloud & Enterprise Agents &gt; Agents Settings**](https://app.thousandeyes.com/settings/agents/enterprise/?section=agents) menu, you'll see some or all of the following menus, depending on your account's permissions and those of your organization. Agent configuration in the UI is organized as follows.:

1. Agents tab containing Clusters, Notifications, Kerberos Settings tabs
2. Cloud Agents listing tab
3. Agent Labels list and label creation tab
4. Proxy Settings list and proxy configuration tab

## Enterprise Agents

Enterprise Agents are lightweight Linux-based software agents that run tests configured in the ThousandEyes platform, and upload the results to ThousandEyes for aggregation and analysis.  Refer to this [Knowledge Base article](https://success.thousandeyes.com/ViewArticle?articleIdParam=kA0E0000000CmnbKAC) for a fuller description of Enterprise Agents.  If you have a role with the _View agents in account group_ permission, such as the default Account Admin or Organization Admin roles, you can view the Enterprise Agents listing.

### Agents tab

If the Account Group has installed at least one Enterprise Agent, then navigating to the  [**Cloud & Enterprise Agents &gt;** ](https://app.thousandeyes.com/settings/agents/enterprise/?section=agents)[ **Agent Settings &gt; Enterprise Agents**](https://app.thousandeyes.com/settings/agents/enterprise/?section=agents) menu will display a listing of the Enterprise Agents, under the **Agents** tab:

1. **Agents/Clusters/Notifications/Kerberos tab:** Click the tab to display listings of either individual Enterprise Agents, Enterprise Agent Clusters.  Select or configure Notification Rules and Kerberos Settings under these tabs.
2. **Search box:** Enter a text string to search for your Agent\(s\).  The string can be either text or an IP address.  The Agent Name, Hostname and public and private IP address fields \(visible when an Agent's row is expanded\) will be searched.  Matches are displayed in the listing.
3. **Total Agents:** The number of Enterprise Agents assigned to this organization.
4. **Account Group filter:** Display either the Enterprise Agents assigned to the current Account Group or those Enterprise Agents not in the current account group. The sum of the two categories should be the number displayed in \#3.  The user must have _View agents in account group_ permission to view Enterprise Agents in the relevant account groups. Click the column header to sort in one of two directions.
5. **Agent Name:** Displays the name given to the Enterprise Agent, located in the Agent Name field. Click the column header to sort in one of two directions.
6. **Hostname:** Displays the hostname given to the Enterprise Agent. The hostname is either a name or a domain name, taken from the 'hostname' command run on the Agent. Click the column header to sort in one of two directions.

    To the left of the hostname are icons indicating the following:

7. **Utilization:** The highest percentage of the currently active Agent Utilization queues \(visible when an Agent's row is expanded\). Utilization queues  measure the amount of test time slots used for various types of tests.  As utilization values near 100%, tests of the type measured by the queue are more likely to fail to run before the next round of tests commences, producing a "No data" result for the Agent running the test. Click the column header to sort in one of two directions.
8. **Status/Last Contact:** The time since the Enterprise Agent last contacted the ThousandEyes collector. The Last Contact of the Agent--Collector connection is rendered with a green dot if the Agent status is "Online". If the Agent has not contacted the ThousandEyes collector for more than .5 hour, the status is set to "Offline" and rendered with a red dot.  If the Agent has been disabled, the status is set to "Disabled" and rendered in grey.  Click the column header to sort in one of two directions.
9. **Options** menu**:** Reveals options to perform below specified actions on the agent: 
   * **Delete:** Clicking this option permanently deletes the Agent from the Account Group.
   * **Disable:** Click this to disable the Agent. Disabled Agents will continue to contact the ThousandEyes collector to determine whether they have been reenabled. Disabled Agents do not collect test results, but do remain configured, allowing for easy re-enabling in the future. Disabled Agents do not count towards an organization's limit of concurrent Enterprise Agents, but may count towards the monthly quota, depending on when and how long the Enterprise Agent was deployed.
10. **Add New Enterprise Agent** button**:** Reveals side pane with Enterprise Agent install options arranged in tabs based on Package Type.

#### Agent Settings

Click on the row of any Enterprise Agent to expand the row for access to the Agent Settings.  The Agent Settings will display three tabs: Basic Configuration, Advanced Settings and Agent Statistics. Additionally, panels on the right provide detailed Agent information and some administrative options. Note that the Basic Configuration will not be visible if the Agent is assigned to an Enterprise Agent Cluster, and other parts of the interface will change or to reflect the Agent's membership in the Cluster.  Information no longer available under the Agent will be available under the Agent's Cluster.

**Basic Configuration**

The Agent must have connectivity to the ThousandEyes collector to reset the password in this way. Console access also can be used to reset the password via a text menu.
13. **Cancel:** Click this button to cancel changes to the Agent Settings.
14. **Save Changes:** Click this button to save changes to the Agent configuration.

**Advanced Settings**

1. IPv6 **Policy:** Choose a name resolution policy for non browser based tests. Below are the available options:
   * IPv4 Only
   * Prefer IPv6
   * Force IPv6
2. **Target for Tests IP Address:** Used by Network/Agent-to-Agent and Voice/RTP tests to specify the IP address that the testing Agents will use to target this Agent. By default, this is the IP address of the Agent's network interface. Normally, if the testing Agents' packets are traversing the public Internet, the **Target for Tests** field should be set to the IP address shown in the **Public IP Address** field on the Basic Configuration tab.  If the testing Agents' packets are traversing a private network, the **Target for Tests** field should be set to the IP address shown in the **Private IP Address** field of this Agent Settings page.
3. **Behind a NAT:** Check this box to enable NAT traversal. Checking this box will allow Agents running Network/Agent-to-Agent tests to initiate connections to this Enterprise Agent if it is behind a NAT'ing firewall or similar device without the need for port forwarding rules on the device. See [NAT Traversal for Agent to Agent tests](https://success.thousandeyes.com/ViewArticle?articleIdParam=kA0E0000000CmnWKAS) for more information on NAT traversal.
4. **Verify SSL certificates for browser tests:** Check this box to verify the chain of SSL certificates when running Page Load or Transaction tests.  Leave the box unchecked to ignore certificate-related errors, such as self-signed certificates, expired certificates, certificates whose CN fields do not match the URL used to access the resource, etc.  Note that this is an Agent-wide setting, so will apply to all Page Load or Transaction tests assigned to this Agent.
5. **Keep browser cache between tests:** Check this box to retain cacheable objects retrieved in Web layer tests.  Leave the box uncheck to download all objects with each round of Web layer tests.  Note that this is an Agent-wide setting, so will apply to all Web layer tests.  Also note that cookies are not cached, regardless of whether the browser cache is retained between tests.
6. **Proxy Option:** Select an appropriate proxy option for Scheduled tests. Below are available choices:
   * **Direct:** Do not use proxy.
   * Enterprise Agent's proxy configuration: Use proxy configured in agent's config file\(te-agent.cfg\).
   * Specific proxy configuration: Choose from [in-app proxy configurations](). 
7. **Enable Kerberos:** Enables Kerberos authentication for agent. Credentials are configured in [Kerberos Settings]() tab. 

**Agent Statistics**

1. **Agent Uptime:** A graph of the Agent's connection to the ThousandEyes collector over the past 7 days.
2. **Agent Utilization:** This section charts the Agent Utilization per Test type for the last 24 hours. Only those Test types which the Agent is running are displayed. [Utilization](https://success.thousandeyes.com/PublicArticlePage?articleIdParam=kA044000000CnjgCAC_Enterprise-Agent-Utilization) for a ThousandEyes Enterprise Agent means the amount of time slots in the test queue that are filled by running tests. A high utilization indicates that the Agent is barely managing to complete all tests assigned to it, each round.

#### Adding an Enterprise Agent

If you have a role with the _Edit agents_ permission, such as the default Account Admin or Organization Admin roles, you can add new Enterprise Agents. To add a new Agent, Navigate to Agents tab of [**Cloud & Enterprise Agents &gt; Agents Settings**](https://app.thousandeyes.com/settings/agents/enterprise/?section=agents) ****and click the **+ Add New Agent** button.  A side modal containing agent install methods with hyperlinks to respective Install Guide will open up classified in tabs based on Package Type.  

#### Account Group Token

Click on the **Show Account Token for Installation** link, and copy the Account Token to your clipboard or similar location so that you can paste it when needed during the installation.  Be sure to handle the Account Token with appropriate security, as it provides a means of affecting your usage of ThousandEyes resources.  Note that the Account Token is specific to your current Account Group.  All Enterprise Agents installed with this Account Token will belong to this Account Group.

### **Clusters tab**

 If the Account Group has configured at least one Enterprise Agent Cluster, then navigating to the  **Settings &gt; Agents &gt; Enterprise Agents** menu will display a listing of the Enterprise Agent Clusters, under the **Agents** tab:

For more information about Agent clusters, refer to the ThousandEyes Knowledge Base article [Working with Enterprise Agent Clusters](https://success.thousandeyes.com/ViewArticle?articleIdParam=kA0E0000000CmngKAC). 

## Notification Rules

For an organization's Enterprise Agents, notifications can be generated on three types of events:

* _Last Contact_ with the ThousandEyes collector less than or greater than a number of minutes  The default time limit is 30 minutes.  Agents normally contact the ThousandEyes collector every minute.
* _Clock Offset_ of the Enterprise Agent from true value less than or greater than a number of seconds  The data collected by ThousandEyes requires accurate timestamps. If an Enterprise Agent's clock varies from the ThousandEyes collector's time by a significant fraction of the frequency of any test the Agent is running, then the test data can be affected.  Most commonly, this condition arises when the Agent cannot reach the Agent's Network Time Protocol \(NTP\) servers via the network.  Notification rules can be configured to ensure that the Agent's clock drift generates a notification.
* _Agent Version is Outdated_  Triggered when the **Agent Version** from the **Cloud & Enterprise Agents &gt; Agents Settings &gt; Enterprise Agents t**ab indicates the Agent's version is less than the current version available.  Normally, Enterprise Agents automatically update their Agent software, but if conditions prevent update, notification can be generated.

Navigate to the **Cloud & Enterprise Agents &gt; Agents Settings &gt; Enterprise Agents &gt; Notification** tab and click the **Add New Notification Rule** button to add a new Rule or click on a row to expand the row and view the settings of an existing Rule.  As with any Alert or Notification Rule, some period of experimentation may be required to tune the criteria so that the Rule is neither too noisy nor failing to notify users of valuable events.

1. **Search:** Enter a text string to search for Notification Rules based on the name of the Rule.
2. **Name:** The name of the Notification Rule.  Click the column title to sort in one of two directions.
3. **Conditions:** Lists the conditions of the Notification Rule.
4. **Agents:** Indicates the number of Enterprise Agents to which this Rule has been assigned.
5. **Default:** Check this box to assign the Rule to all Agents created subsequent to the Rule becoming a default.  There is no limit to the number of Default Rules.
6. **Options** button: Reveals options to **Delete** and **Duplicate** the Notification Rule.
7. **Add New Notification Rule** button**:** Opens up a side pane with blank notification rule form. 

### Creating a New Notification Rule

To add a new notification rule, Navigate to Notifications tab of [**Cloud & Enterprise Agents &gt; Agents Settings**](https://app.thousandeyes.com/settings/agents/enterprise/?section=agents) ****and click the **+ Add New Notification Rule** button to reveal the below side pane:

Configure appropriate values for below settings: 

1. **Notification Name:** The name of the Notification Rule.  Be aware that there is no uniqueness constraint on Notification Names.
2. **Enterprise Agents:** Click the selector and check the boxes of the Enterprise Agents to which this Notification Rule will be assigned.
3. **All/Any operator:** Set the selector to _Any_ \(logical OR\) or _All_ \(logical AND\) which applies to the conditions listed below.
4. **Conditions:** As explained above, Last Contact, Clock Offset or _Agent Version is Outdated_, along with the appropriate operator and operand, if applicable.
5. **Add/remove conditions:** Click **+** to add a new condition or **-** to remove an existing condition. A minimum of one condition is required.
6. **Notification tab:** Configure notifications for this rule. 

For information on the Notifications tab, see the [Notifications section](https://success.thousandeyes.com/PublicArticlePage?articleIdParam=kA044000000CnBqCAK_How-Alerts-work) of the ThousandEyes Knowledge Base article [How Alerts Work](https://success.thousandeyes.com/PublicArticlePage?articleIdParam=kA044000000CnBqCAK_How-Alerts-work). Once done click **Add** button to create notification rule.

## Kerberos Settings

The Kerberos Settings tab is where configurations for this method of authentication are listed.  Typically an Enterprise Agent authenticating to a Microsoft Windows Server will use this method.  Navigate to the **Cloud & Enterprise Agents &gt; Agents Settings &gt; Enterprise Agents &gt; Kerberos** tab to list or create a new configuration.  To setup new authentication schemes click the **Add Kerberos Configuration** button. Fill in Configuration Name, Realm, Username, Password, Kerberos Key Distribution Center \(KDC\) Host, KDC Port, Whitelisted IP address range or subnet.  Then add an associated Enterprise Agent.
