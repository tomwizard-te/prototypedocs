# Release Notes: 2012-04-11

Changes in this release:

* **Use your email address instead of your username to log in**. From now on, our login system will use your primary email address \(already in the system\) to identify you. You'll no longer need to remember a separate username.
* We have **a new way to explore the Network Topology view**. In addition to expanding hops in the middle of _all_paths, you can now expand all of the hops on a single path. Just click on the hop count on any path to show all of the hidden hops.
* **Permalinks are now available for all views**. Look for the small "permalink" widget at the top right corner of the page. Click it to reveal the direct url to the view, complete with its current state. You can send these links to other users to share the particular data point that you're looking at. We've already found it extremely useful for sharing events within the ThousandEyes team!
* As promised in the last release, **organization admins can now switch between accounts**. Just click on your name on the top right of the page to bring up the account settings menu. At the bottom of the menu, you'll find the "Switch Accounts" link.
