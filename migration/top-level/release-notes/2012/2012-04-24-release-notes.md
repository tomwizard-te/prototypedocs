# Release Notes: 2012-04-24

Here at ThousandEyes, we have been busy over the last couple of weeks working on some cool new features for this release:

* **New logo** - as part of the upcoming revamp of [www.thousandeyes.com](http://www.thousandeyes.com/), we now have a brand new logo!
* **New menu** - the interface has a brand new top menu and navigation; all views are now under a single entry called "Views" and categorized by layer \(Network, DNS, DNS+, HTTP, UXM\). _Instant tests_ can now be found under _Reports - Instant Test Report_. We also renamed a few of the views for clarity.
* **New breadcrumbs** - at the top of each page, you will now find navigation breadcrumbs to help you orient yourself and move between views.
* **Data shows up faster in views** - we redesigned our backend so that users can receive data for their tests faster; now there can be partial aggregations in the last round of data available from the timeline for tests that are run from agents.
* **Graphs replaced by Reports** - due to the overlap in functionality we decided to merge the _Graphs_ view into_Reports_. We plan to add some more report templates in the future to make it easier to slice and dice data, including a comparative report to compare one or more tests head to head.
* **Highlight expanded nodes in Path Visualization graphs** - after clicking on the number of hops on a path, the new nodes that become visible will _flash_ for a short time. This makes it easier to identify which nodes were added.
