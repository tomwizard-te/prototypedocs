# Release Notes: 2012-06-20

New in this release:

* **Sharing using public links** - users can now share a view of a test with anyone through a public link similar to[https://share.thousandeyes.com/pub/zZnCSIvssfdRTyA7](https://share.thousandeyes.com/pub/zZnCSIvssfdRTyA7)

  Shared views are fully interactive with timeline navigation and ability to move between layers. The user sharing the view needs to specify the interval of time they want to share. Public links can be disabled at any time by the user that created them or by the account admin via [Sharing Settings](https://platform.thousandeyes.com/account/sharing).

* **DNS trace test** - we added a DNS test that traverses the entire resolution chain similar to what _dig +trace_ does; we created a new view for this test called [Domain Trace](https://platform.thousandeyes.com/dns/trace).
* **Alert for page not loaded** - for Page Load tests, we now have alerts to detect cases where the page load is incomplete.
