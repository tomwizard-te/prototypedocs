# Release Notes: 2017-08-02

### Release Update 2017-08-02

Welcome to tonight's release!

Normally, in this portion of the Release Update, we provide you with information and links to our latest ThousandEyes blog posts. In our previous release, we had none to give--a consequence of summer vacations and other factors. Tonight, we're making up for that shortfall with four terrific new blog posts.

First up: Product Manager Gopi Gopalakrishnan's [What’s New in Q2?](https://blog.thousandeyes.com/whats-new-q2-2017-product-updates/), which reviews the new features introduced in the past three months, highlighted by "The Sight of Sound" review of our new Voice-over-IP tests. If you missed the first the quarterly feature round-up, check out the Q1 installment [here](https://blog.thousandeyes.com/new-may-2017-dashboard-widgets-api/).

Next, for those who weren't able to attend our last ThousandEyes Connect event, or if you attended and wanted to review some of the great presentations from ThousandEyes customers, here's your chance. Our Marketing team's Archana Kesavan has a nicely summarized and illustrated \(presentation slides included\) post on the presentation by Daniel Shanahan, Staff Network Performance Engineer at Intuit, entitled [How Intuit Monitors Connectivity to AWS](https://blog.thousandeyes.com/how-intuit-monitors-connectivity-aws/). From the tax software company that processes more returns in the cloud every April than anyone else, some great and practical architecture and implementation info from Daniel, describing how ThousandEyes helps keep those returns flowing between the AWS cloud and Intuit's infrastructure.

And still more stories of real-world experience... If your company uses Marketo, the marketing automation software product, then your marketing department probably noticed that Marketo's online resources were unavailable for a time last week. What caused it? Young Xu's [blog post](https://blog.thousandeyes.com/what-happened-when-marketos-domain-name-expired/) will tell you, ThousandEyes-style \(meaning, we got data and pretty graphs covering the period of the outage for you to explore, interactively\).

But wait, there's more. ThousandEyes' Chief Information Security Officer, Alexander Anoufriev, has a blog post for those of you interested in certification and compliance. Entitled [Five Reasons Why ISO 27001 Certification Matters](https://blog.thousandeyes.com/five-reasons-why-iso-27001-certification-matters/), the post describes the drivers behind ThousandEyes' push for ISO 27001 certification.

And now, the details of tonights release.

## Cloud Agents

### IPv6 Cloud Agents

Continuing to grow our IPv6 Cloud Agent presence internationally, we've added Bucharest, Romania this week to the list of available IPv6 locations.

### IPv4 Cloud Agents

Another addition to the US-based IPv4 Cloud Agents: Baltimore, Maryland. Crab cakes and Cloud Agents for all!

## Dashboards

Similar to the Reports widgets, you can now embed Dashboard widgets in your web portals. Click the **Add/Manage Widgets** button in the Dashboard containing the widget you wish to embed, and select Embed Widget from the **More Actions** menu:

Click the **Allow anyone to embed this widget onto external sites** box. The window expands to display the embed's HTML code snippet, which uses an &lt;iframe&gt; tag. The window also displays a preview of the widget.

A role with one of the Edit Dashboards... permissions is required to access the Embedded Widget feature.
