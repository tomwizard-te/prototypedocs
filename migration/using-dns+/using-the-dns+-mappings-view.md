# Using the DNS+ Mappings view

DNS+ provides visibility into worldwide DNS data, from thousands of vantage points in the form of open resolvers present on the Internet.  DNS+ is an optional module that is built to provide DNS visibility over and above the agent-based insight provided by the ThousandEyes platform, and as such, not all organizations will have access to the DNS+ test suite.  

The DNS+ Mappings view leverages the ThousandEyes DNS+ layout, documented here:[https://support.thousandeyes.com/ViewArticle?articleIdParam=kA0E0000000CmmgKAC](https://success.thousandeyes.com/ViewArticle?articleIdParam=kA0E0000000CmmgKAC).  This article highlights specifics shown in the DNS+ Mappings view.

## Example

The DNS+ Mappings view effectively takes each the IP address resolved by worldwide DNS resolvers, and shows how many resolvers worldwide respond to the domain trace using that IP address.  This allows visibility into Geographic Load balancing, content delivery networks, and DNS Cache Poisoning.  The example below shows a DNS+ Mappings view for thousandeyes.com MX.

## View Specifics

The DNS+ Mappings view has one control that others within the DNS+ family don't: the mappings selector.  This selector allows you to choose which mapping you wish to review.  Once a mapping is selected, the density of the mapping will be shown, based on the shade of blue in the map.  Countries shaded in dark blue show the densest concentration of resolvers responding on this IP, whereas light blue indicates light concentration.

As with other DNS+ views, the view is somewhat different depending on whether or not a country is selected.

          <br />The mapping selector will display for each mapping, the percentage of

        <p>The computed averages area will show the percentage of vantage points
          mapping to the selected mapping, the number of vantage points used for
          the test at the date/time selected, and the number of mappings returned
          globally. When a domain trace returns more than 1 mapping, then either
          geographic load balancing, CDN-based delivery, or DNS cache poisoning is
          in play. Number of mappings is a valid alert criterion, and can be used
          to trigger alerts for DNS+ tests.</p>
