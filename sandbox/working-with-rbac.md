# Working with RBAC

Managing users is done under the [Account Groups](https://app.thousandeyes.com/settings/account/?section=accountgroups), [Users](https://app.thousandeyes.com/settings/account/?section=users), and [Roles](https://app.thousandeyes.com/settings/account/?section=roles) tabs of the [Account Settings](https://app.thousandeyes.com/settings/account) page. Users may also modify their own settings under the [Profile](https://app.thousandeyes.com/settings/account/?section=profile) tab.

####  Default built-in Roles

All accounts come preloaded with 3 default roles: **Organization Admin, Account Admin** plus the **Regular Users** role. The permission assigned to each of these 3 predefined roles are fixed but you can duplicate any of these Roles and then customize them to suit your requirements. When hovering over a permission title in the UI a tooltip will appear explaining in more detail what the permission does but in general, the titles are self-explanatory. For instructions on how to use the features under the Roles tab please navigate to the following section on [Managing Roles](https://success.thousandeyes.com/Articles?category=User_Management#Managing-Roles). Currently, we have more than 90 permissions available for you to choose from. For a full list of permissions assigned to the **Organization Admin**, **Account Admin** plus the **Regular Users** role check the [Roles and Permissions table](https://success.thousandeyes.com/Articles?category=User_Management#Permissions-Table).  
  
The permissions assigned to a user with an **Organization Admin** role \(or similar\) enables them to do the following:

* access all **Account Groups** defined within the organization
* fully manage all Users and Roles
* view and create tests, shares, dashboards and reports
* assign agents to any Account Group belonging to the organization
* edit security settings, view billing information and change payment details

The permissions assigned to a user with an **Account Admin** role \(or similar\) are able to do the following:

* access the API
* create, edit and view snapshots
* create, edit and view transaction tests
* edit agents, alerts, notifications, endpoint agent and label settings
* access the [Profile](https://app.thousandeyes.com/settings/account/?section=profile), [Users](https://app.thousandeyes.com/settings/account/?section=users) and [Activity Log](https://app.thousandeyes.com/settings/account/?section=activityLog) tabs under the [Account Settings](https://app.thousandeyes.com/settings/account) page. If access to the other account settings tabs is required e.g. [Roles](https://app.thousandeyes.com/settings/account/?section=roles), [Quotas](https://app.thousandeyes.com/settings/account/?section=quotas) or [Organization](https://app.thousandeyes.com/settings/account/?section=organization) please assign the user the role of **Organization Admin** \(or similar\).
* view sensitive transaction test settings e.g. usernames and passwords in the [test settings](https://app.thousandeyes.com/settings/tests/?tab=settings) or [test view](https://app.thousandeyes.com/view/tests) pages

 **Note: The Account Admin role only has permissions to create, edit or delete users within their assigned account group.** 

The permissions assigned to a user with a **Regular Users** role \(or similar\) enables them to do the following:

* access all test results and read-only access to test settings
* customize their dashboards
* reset their password
* create and delete their own shares, snapshots
* check their own activity log
* run instant tests but are not able to save/create them

####  Managing Roles

Roles and Permissions settings are all contained under the [Account Settings &gt; Users & Roles &gt; Roles](https://app.thousandeyes.com/account-settings/users-roles/?section=roles) tab. To create a new Role choose the **Add New Role** button or to customize an existing role choose the pencil icon; both options will place you in Role edit mode. Once you are finished editing your Role ensure you use the **Save Changes** button to save your changes. A reminder on editing default built-in Roles: you have to duplicate a built-in Role using the duplicate icon before you can customise it.

![Role-Based-Access-Control\_Roles.png](https://success.thousandeyes.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka02R000000UPcu&feoid=00NE0000006OT0r&refid=0EM2R000000p2vN)  
_Figure 1: Roles tab page and features_

1. Search bar: Allows searching using a string such as "email" or "alert" for matching permissions.  The number in parentheses is the number of Permissions currently displayed.  Additionally, there are two buttons:
   * All - displays the full list of permissions that match the search string
   * Lock icon - displays only Management permissions that match the search string
2. Search filter selection: Filters the permissions column by **All Permissions**, **Management Permissions** or **component.** The component filter options available are: 
   * Admin
   * Alerts
   * API
   * BGP
   * Cloud and Enterprise Agents
   * Dashboard
   * Devices
   * Endpoint Agents
   * Labels
   * Live Shares
   * Saved Events
   * Snapshots
   * Tests
3. Role change icons: Allows creation of new Roles via duplication of an existing Role, or editing or deleting of existing Roles
4. Permission names: Lists the Permissions names which match the current search string
5. Roles: Lists the names of the built-in Roles and any customer-defined roles.  In this example, there is a customer-defined role "Limited Admin 1" in addition to the three built-in roles.  Use the scroll bar at the bottom of the display to move horizontally through the columns if more Roles are present that can be viewed in the current page size.  Use the scroll bar at the right to move vertically through the rows of Permissions.
6. Management permissions: A lock icon next to a Permission name is there to indicate the Permission is a Management Permission. A Management Permission allows a user to change their own or another user's permissions or scope of permissions, view and edit billing information, manage quotas and delete accounts. They are given the special indication of a lock icon to set them apart from other permissions and to ensure they are applied with care.

**Example custom Role**

 The following table is an example of a commonly configured custom Role used by ThousandEyes users.

 If there are any custom roles you think would benefit you or other users do [let the Customer Success Team know](https://success.thousandeyes.com/PublicArticlePage?articleIdParam=kA044000000UGTFCA4_Getting-support-from-ThousandEyes) and we'll consider adding them to the table above.

#### Adding User\(s\)

To add new users, click on the **Add New Users** button.  The **Add New Users** panel will appear:

![Role-Based-Access-Control\_Add-Users.png](https://success.thousandeyes.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka02R000000UPcu&feoid=00NE0000006OT0r&refid=0EM2R000000oxns)

1. Emails: Enter one or more email addresses which will be used by the users as logins to the ThousandEyes platform.

An email with instructions to complete registration will be automatically sent to each address.

After the user account is created, the user will receive an email from the ThousandEyes platform requesting that the user complete the registration process.

If the administrator wishes to provide the name, the Edit User panel under the Users tab allows for manual entry.
